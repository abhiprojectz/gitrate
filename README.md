# What's behind creating this?

Actually very few people star your repo, as a open-source developer we all faces it , 
so in order to overcome this, i decided to create this service as its looks new(at least on github readme repo pages) and there is a greator/higher probabilty poeple may notice it.

You can apply it on any static site easily & whenever a user clicks on one of the buttons thier records is updated just paste the markdown code.

Grab it here: [gitrate on heroku](https://gitrate.herokuapp.com/)

The generator is super simple!

# How to integrate ?

You can easily setup this at the end or at start of your repo!
Its way simple:

+ 1. Copy your github repo url.
+ 2. visit the gitrate generator [here](https://gitrate.herokuapp.com/)
+ 3. Copy the markdown codes.
+ 4. Paste it wherever you want!

Alternatively, you can generate url via urself just set `ref` param as (username).(repoName) without paranthies`()` like: `abhiprojectz.gitrate`

so our url becomes: `[![](https://gitrate.herokuapp.com/happy?ref=abhiprojectz.gitrate)](https://gitrate.herokuapp.com/happy/done?ref=abhiprojectz.gitrate)`

If you want you can insert using  html attribute to `<img src=''>`.
